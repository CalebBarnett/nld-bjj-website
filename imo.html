        <p>
          The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu world lost a rare and exceptional individual in
          <strong>Steve Hannah</strong>, who passed away on Friday, January 26, 2007,
          at the age of 41. A native of Liberty, Missouri, Steve courageously fought
          a year-long battle with a malignant brain tumor and passed peacefully in
          his own home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Awarded his black belt by Professor Pedro Sauer in 2006, Steve was a
          uniquely talented and compassionate instructor whose influence extended
          far beyond the mats. In addition to being a highly respected Jiu-Jitsu
          practitioner, Steve was an accomplished physician practicing Radiology
          at Liberty Hospital and was pursuing a law degree at the time of his passing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Steve began his Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu journey more than a decade earlier,
          training extensively under Rickson Gracie lineage through Rodrigo Vaghi,
          and later directly with Rickson Gracie himself. Driven by an uncompromising
          dedication to fundamentals and precision, Steve became a steward of
          old-school Helio Gracie–style Jiu-Jitsu, emphasizing repetition, discipline,
          and personal responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          He trained and taught relentlessly, often from a small basement training
          space affectionately known as “the Bat Cave,” where he mentored a tight-knit
          group of students. Among them was Jesse Hernandez, whom Steve met through
          a local judo club. The two became lifelong friends and training partners,
          rolling together until the very end of Steve’s life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meeting Professor Pedro Sauer marked a turning point in Steve’s journey.
          He described it as “an answer to a prayer” and credited both Rickson Gracie
          and Pedro Sauer as his greatest influences—not only in Jiu-Jitsu, but in
          character. Steve sought to reflect that same integrity, humility, and
          excellence in his own teaching.
        </p>

        <p>
          Diagnosed with stage IV brain cancer in 2005, Steve refused to surrender
          his lifelong goal of earning his black belt. Despite surgery, radiation,
          and physical hardship, he returned to the mats and demonstrated the depth
          of his understanding before Professor Sauer, earning his black belt through
          sheer determination and faith.
        </p>

        <p>
          Steve was also a bold follower of Jesus Christ, known for his thoughtful,
          reasoned faith and confidence in eternal life. Because of this confidence,
          he asked that his passing be celebrated rather than mourned.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>

        <p>
          Steve Hannah was the first instructor to guide the founders of NLD Judo & BJJ.
          His insistence on fundamentals, patience, and character continues to shape
          our approach to training today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Steve is survived by his wife of 18 years, Anne, and their four children:
          Emily, Claire, Ethan, and Christian.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Steve, you are loved.  
            You are missed.  
            And your legacy lives on—on the mats and in the lives you shaped.
          </strong>
