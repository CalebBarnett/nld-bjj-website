      <div class="container">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> NLD Judo & Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is built around fundamentals, consistency, and respect for the process. Training emphasizes sound mechanics, positional understanding, and techniques that hold up under pressure. </p>
        <p> The approach is rooted in traditional principles of judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu — prioritizing balance, control, timing, and efficiency over shortcuts or trend-driven systems. </p>
        <p> Classes are structured and intentional, with an expectation that students train to improve their understanding of movement and position over time. Progress is earned through repetition, accountability, and consistent work on the mat. </p>

        <p> Classes are structured and instructor-led. Each session typically includes focused instruction, positional work, and controlled live training. </p>
        <p> No prior experience is required. New students are expected to listen, ask questions when appropriate, and train at a pace that allows for learning and safety. </p>
        <p> Training can be physically demanding, but it is not chaotic. Control, awareness, and respect for training partners are expected at all times. </p>
        <p> Students should arrive on time, prepared to train, and willing to work within the structure of the class. </p>
